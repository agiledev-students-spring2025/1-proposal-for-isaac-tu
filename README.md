# Project Proposal

## Project title

Instagram Influencer Analytics Collaboration

### What and why?

Instagram influencers often struggle to make videos that consistently go viral. I want to develop an app that allows creators to input their insights in exchange for results that a model gets from analyzing thousands of users insights on hundreds of thousands of videos. In other words, they would be adding to the model while getting benefits from other creators who have helped train the model.

### For whom?

The model will be for anyone who posts on instagram reels and wants to go viral. 

### How?

A user will have to meet a certain critera (x amount of views, etc.) to be able to input their information into the model. The model will use ML principles to figure out the best insights that matter in terms of virality and it will give monthly reports to "members" of the model who agree to repeatedley exchange their data into the model. 

### Scope
If we can figure out a way to use an Instagram API or webscraping to obtain insights, then the training the model and creating the website will definitely be feasible.
